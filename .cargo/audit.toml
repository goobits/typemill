# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack in rsa crate
#
# Status: No patched version available (as of 2025-11-13)
# Severity: Medium (CVSS 5.9)
# Impact: Potential RSA private key recovery through timing sidechannels
#
# Risk Assessment:
# - TypeMill runs as a local MCP server, not exposed to network attackers
# - Exploit requires ability to observe timing information over network
# - Upstream fix is in development (migration to constant-time crypto-bigint)
#
# Mitigation:
# - Monitor RustCrypto/RSA issue #390 for stable fix
# - Update jsonwebtoken when new version with patched rsa is available
# - Consider alternative JWT libraries if networked deployment is needed
#
# Decision: Accepting risk for local development/deployment use cases
