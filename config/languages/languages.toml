# Language Plugin Registry
#
# This file is the single source of truth for all language plugin metadata.
# It is used by build.rs to generate:
# - ProjectLanguage enum variants (crates/cb-core/src/language.rs)
# - LanguageMetadata constants (crates/cb-plugin-api/src/metadata.rs)
# - Workspace dependencies (root Cargo.toml)
# - Plugin registration (crates/cb-services/src/services/registry_builder.rs)
#
# DO NOT edit the generated files directly. Edit this file and run `cargo build`.
#
# NOTE: Language support temporarily reduced to TypeScript + Rust during unified API refactoring.
#       Multi-language support (Python, Go, Java, Swift, C#) preserved in git tag `pre-language-reduction`
#       and will be restored after unified API is stable.
